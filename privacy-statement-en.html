<h2>Existence of automated decision-making</h2>

<p> We do not use automatic decision-making or profiling (Art 13 para. 2 lit. f GDPR).</p>

<h2>Purposes and legal bases of the processing of your personal data</h2>

<h3>a. Usage of Smart4Health platform and MyScience App</h3>

<p>This consent does not affect your prior approval to the terms and conditions of the Smart4Health platform and the
    MyScience App. The terms and conditions of the MyScience App can be found here (<a
            href="https://myscience-app.smart4health.eu/terms-of-use-en.html">click link</a>).</p>

<h3>b. Local storage and processing of (technical) data and information on your individual device</h3>

<p>The MyScience App requires only a minimum of data to ensure that we can offer you the service and functionalities of
    the MyScience App. When you use the MyScience App the following data is processed and persisted solely locally which
    means on your individual device, e.g., smartphone, computer or tablet):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Technical credentials' information for accessing your health data, for example from the Citizen Health Data
        Platform of the Smart4Health project
    </li>
    <li>Pseudonym Secret (to create pseudonyms)</li>
    <li>Your Data Selection choices</li>
    <li>Your Re-Contact choices</li>
</ul>
<p> In order to keep the amount of personal data as limited as possible, the MyScience App does not require a
    registration by the app user. Instead, we create a temporary anonymous account using the 3rd party service Google
    Firebase Authentication to allow the required and secure communication to our servers. For this purpose, your IP
    address will be temporarily stored by Google. Firebase is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web
    applications. Google provides its services in relation with the Firebase platform as a data processor for HPI.</p>

<p> To ensure that the MyScience App will work smoothly and seamlessly if you change your individual device and install
    the MyScience-App on a new individual device, the MyScience App relies on the Android Backup service. The following
    data will be processed for this purpose </p>
<ul>
    <li>Hash of credentials' information mentioned above</li>
    <li>Pseudonym Secret (to create pseudonyms)</li>
    <li>Your Data Selection choices</li>
    <li>Your Re-Contact choices</li>
</ul>
<p> The processing of this data is technically necessary and is carried out in order to provide you the offering. The
    legal basis for the aforementioned processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR (processing is necessary for
    the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party).</p>

<h3>c. Providing your consent to data provision by using the consent service</h3>

<p> In order to provide a legally sound consent for providing data to research, you must provide your name and signature
    to sign the consent document. The processing of this data is legally necessary. The following data will be persisted
    on a server for the aforementioned purpose: </p>
<ul>
    <li>First name</li>
    <li>Last name</li>
    <li>Date of signing the consent</li>
    <li>Email</li>
    <li>Consent PDF Document (including signature)</li>
    <li>Consent Flow Id (Derived from Firebase Anonymous Login / Subject)</li>
</ul>
<p> In order to receive the aforementioned consent flow ID, the service Firebase Authentication is used (see the
    information on Google Firebase above in b). </p>
<p> The legal basis for the aforementioned processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. b GDPR (processing is necessary
    for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party). The consent document containing name and
    signature will be stored for a minimum until the Smart4Health project is completed and for a maximum period of three
    years after completion of the project and can only be retrieved using your pseudonymised personal reference.</p>

<h3>d. Providing health data to research</h3>
<p> If you select health data to be provided to research, this data containing sensitive personal and health-related
    information is transferred to our servers. This data is never stored on our servers, but processed to be
    de-identified. The de-identified data, which contains no personal data, is forwarded to the Smart4Health Research
    Platform. If you consent to being recontacted, a pseudonymised personal reference is added to the data. The legal
    basis for the aforementioned processing is your consent (Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a and Art. 6 para.1 lit. a GDPR). The
    lawfulness of the processing made on the basis of the consent up to your withdrawal remains unaffected by your
    withdrawal. You can declare your withdrawal, for example, by revoking the consent from within the MyScience app.</p>
<p> For providing the data to the research platform, the following data is processed, but not saved
    permanently/persisted</p>

<ul>
    <li>Protected Health Information which can include personal identifiers</li>
    <li>Pseudonym Secret (to create pseudonyms)</li>
</ul>
<p> The data provision service persists the following data permanently on our servers</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pseudonymized personal reference (pseudonym)</li>
    <li>Hash of Health Data to ensure data integrity</li>
    <li>Timestamp (Date and time of the request )</li>
    <li>Fixed random number for shifting dates in health data to maximize data privacy</li>
</ul>
<p> The processing of this data is technically necessary and is carried out in order to provide you the offering. The
    legal basis for the aforementioned processing is Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 point (b) GDPR (processing is necessary
    for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party). The above-mentioned data will be stored
    maximum until three years after the project is completed.</p>

<h3>e. Being contacted by researchers</h3>
<p> If your consent allows this, researchers intending to reach out to you can send messages which include your
    pseudonymised personal reference to our servers. Each request is screened and approved by the Data Access Committee
    before it is sent to you via the MyScience App. Researchers never receive personal information about you. </p>
<p> The recontacting service is persisting the following information in order to fulfil its service</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pseudonymized personal reference (pseudonym)</li>
    <li>Message (incl. delivery state, timestamps)</li>
    <li>Timestamps</li>
    <li>Reference IDs to the Ticket System</li>
</ul>
<p> The legal basis for the aforementioned processing is your consent (Art. 9 para. 2 lit. a and Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a
    GDPR). The lawfulness of the processing made on the basis of the consent up to your withdrawal remains unaffected by
    your withdrawal. You can declare your withdrawal, for example, by revoking the consent in the MyScience app.</p>

<h3>f. Anonymous analysis for troubleshooting purposes</h3>
<p> We use the 3rd party service Google Firebase in the app for the analysis of possible errors in our MyScience App and
    thus for the continuous optimization of the App. Google in its function as a data processor for us, processes the
    following anonymous data for this purpose: </p>
<ul>
    <li>Technical data, such as information about the device you are using and the</li>
    <li>Time of a possible error or crash of the system</li>
    <li>Firebase installation IDs / random ID</li>
</ul>
<p>The above-mentioned data is used exclusively to identify the respective error or crash and to correct such problems.
    Neither us nor Google can draw any conclusion on your person on the basis of the data collected for troubleshooting.
    Firebase stores the data mentioned above for a maximum period of 90 days.</p>
<p>The legal basis for the aforementioned processing is our legitimate interest (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1. lit. f GDPR)
    to be able to quickly identify possible sources of errors and causes for crashes of the app in order to be able to
    ensure a stable and secure use of our app for all our users. </p>
