    the contractual provisions of the following terms of use apply:
</p>

<h2>1. Contractual relationship</h2>

<h2>3. Use of the services, user obligations, prohibited behavior</h2>
<p>3.1 The Smart4Health MyScience App is free of charge for you. We do not assume any guarantee or warranty for certain
    functionalities or a certain availability, and we reserve the right to change functionalities of our services,
    unless otherwise agreed, unreasonable for the user or prescribed by law. </p>
<p>3.2 You are responsible to keep your data secret and may not transmit it to third parties or have the app used by
    third parties. Please inform us immediately if you notice any misuse.</p>
<p>3.3 You may only use the Smart4Health MyScience App to give consent and provide your health data for research
    purposes. You are obliged to observe the statutory regulations when using the service. Furthermore and in
    particular, you may not use the services: - to store and/or transmit data, texts, images, files or other

    obscene, hateful, racist or in any other way objectionable according to the relevant statutory provisions or in the

    copyrights, trade secrets, personal rights or property rights; - to store and/or transmit content which you are not
    entitled to pass on/disclose; - to store and/or transmit any material that contains software viruses or other

<p>3.4 You may not use the Smart4Health MyScience App for business purposes without our prior consent.</p>
<h2>4. Limitation of liability</h2>
<p>4.1 The provider is liable for contractual and other claims of the user only for damages of the user</p>
<p>(1) which the provider, his legal representatives or vicarious agents have caused intentionally or grossly
    negligently,</p>
<p>(2) from the injury to life, body or health, which is based on a breach of duty of the provider or one of its legal
    representatives or vicarious agents,</p>
<p>(3) in cases of liability according to the German Product Liability Act, the assumption of a guarantee or damage that
    is due to fraudulent misrepresentation and</p>
<p>(4) which have arisen as a result of a breach of an obligation, the fulfillment of which is essential for the proper
    execution of the contract and the observance of which the user regularly relies on and may rely on (so-called
    cardinal obligation or German „Kardinalpflicht“).</p>
<p>4.2 In cases (1), (2), (3) of the preceding paragraph, the provider’s liability shall be unrestricted. In other cases
    the liability is limited to the foreseeable, contract-typical damage.</p>
<p>4.3 In cases other than those mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 and notwithstanding the following paragraph, the
    liability of the provider is excluded, explicitly in a violation of paragraph 3.3., irrespective of the legal
    grounds.</p>
<p>4.4 The provisions of this limitation of liability do not change the legal burden of proof.</p>
<p>4.5 The above limitations of liability shall apply accordingly to the personal liability of legal representatives,
    employees and vicarious agents of the provider.</p>
<h2>5. Change of the Terms of Use</h2>
<p>5.1 With your consent or if your consent is deemed to have been given pursuant to the following paragraph, we may
    amend the Terms of Use (for example, when we introduce new functionalities).</p>
<p>5.2 If we wish to change the Terms of Use, we will notify you at least 6 weeks before the proposed effective date in
    so-called text form (for example, by email). If you do not object within 6 weeks after receipt of this notification
    in text form, your consent to the change shall be deemed given and the changes shall take effect at the announced
    time. We will refer to this consequence separately in the notification.</p>
<p>5.3 Irrespective of the above provisions, we reserve the right to amend the Terms of Use with effect for the future,
    insofar as this does not affect essential provisions of the contractual relationship with the user and these
    amendments are necessary in order to take account of developments (for example, changes in the legal situation or
    supreme court rulings, fundamental changes in market conditions which lead to a disruption of the basis of business)
    which were not foreseeable by us and the non-consideration of which would lead to a fundamental disruption of the
    contractual relationship.</p>
<h2>6. Final provisions, miscellaneous</h2>
<p>6.1 There are no subsidiary agreements.</p>
<p>6.2 Should individual provisions of these Terms of Use be or become invalid in whole or in part, the remainder of the
    contract shall remain valid. In this case, the invalid provision shall be replaced by the statutory provision.</p>
<p>6.3 German law shall apply with the exclusion of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
    Goods.</p>
<p>6.4 If the user has no place of jurisdiction in Germany or is a merchant, the place of jurisdiction shall be Potsdam.
    A mandatory place of jurisdiction for consumers under EU law remains unaffected.</p>
